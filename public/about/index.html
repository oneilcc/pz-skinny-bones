				<p>there was a day and it was not too long ago where the kids were being kids. they enjoyed what they enjoyed and disowned the same. the kids they hated were the same as the ones they adored, that is a means of their peers.<br />
music was the currency of their culture but most of their nights were spent home with a television or a book. there was nothing in their life outside their reach nor dreams.<br />
slowly they became aware of themselves and eventually they spent less time alone and more time together. awareness has that way about it of sneaking up on you and showing itself to others in the way you compensate for it. you may overcompensate for your feelings of inferiority with a distinct confidence or a distracting humility.<br />
that humility is dangerous, or it can be. but that humility is not awareness. to realize who you are and trouble yourself with seeing it in anyone else is. we are no longer kids and we no longer need to rely on anyone else to tell us how to enjoy.<br />
when there is a riot in the square we understand that there is a number amongst them to be where who they want to be will be. we distance ourselves from in earnest acts of conviction and we seperate ourselves from the crowd by opting for a discussion over a foghorn. we make ourselves feel different by making a difference. we cannot blame the weather on anyone else the same way we cannot appreciate them changing it.<br />
we accept that there are rock stars. we do not ask them to think for us.  </p>
